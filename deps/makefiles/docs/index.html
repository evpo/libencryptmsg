<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The makefiles project is a set of universal makefiles for building any project
with Gnu tools (gcc, Gnu make etc.). The idea is that you write a trivial
Makefile which simply includes these universal makefiles and it does the rest for
you. This makes it very easy to set up new projects and to ensure consistency
of builds in a multi-library project.</p>

<p>These rules do the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>compile all the .cpp or .c files in the current directory</li>
<li>archive the object files together into a single object library</li>
<li>build all other projects on which the current project depends</li>
<li>link an image or shared library</li>
<li>optionally build a wxWidgets application</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> These files are designed for ***Gnu make ONLY***.</p>

<p>A make file contains a set of rules. The scope for writing rules is limited by
the makefile syntax. Therefore it has been necessary to restrict the
flexibility of the universal makefile in order for it to be possible to write
it at all.</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing a Makefile</h2>

<p>The gcc.mak file should be included in your Makefile to set up the default
make rules for gcc.</p>

<pre class="script">
include ../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>Or whatever the path to the gcc.mak file is. A relative path rather than an
absolute path is recommended.</p>

<p>You need to define variables in your Makefile <i>before</i> the include to
control what is to be built:</p>

<dl>

<dt>IMAGE := &lt;path&gt;</dt>

<dd>
<p>This specifies that you are making a program (executable image) and the path gives
both the directory and image name.</p>

<p>e.g. IMAGE := demo</p>

</dd>


<dt>SHARED := &lt;name&gt;</dt>

<dd>
<p>This specifies that you are making a shared library and the name
is the raw name of the library i.e. without the lib prefix or .so suffix.</p>

<p>e.g. SHARED := demo</p>

<p>This will create a shared library called libdemo.so.</p>

</dd>

<dt>neither IMAGE nor SHARED</dt>
<dd>
<p>Without IMAGE or SHARED, the makefile makes a static library containing all the compiled object files.</p>
</dd>

<dt>LIBRARIES := &lt;path&gt; ...</dt>

<dd>
<p>A space-separated list of library directories to include/link into the build. Only libraries
managed by this make system and set of rules should be in the list. See later for how to manage
third-party libraries.</p>

<p>e.g. LIBRARIES := ../stlplus3/containers</p>

<p>Each path should point to the source directory of a project which is also managed by this
makefile system.</p>

<p>Note that the part of the path used to create the project name -
i.e. the last part must be a directory name and must not be "..". In
this case the project name is "containers".</p>

<p>e.g. LIBRARIES := ../stlplus3/source</p>

<p>In this case the "/source" suffix is ignored and the project name is "stlplus3". This project name must be a directory name and must not be "..".</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<p>In addition to these key variables which control what is to be built, there are other variables to control the
details of the build. These modifier variables should be added AFTER the include for the gcc.mak file. The most
useful are those that allow other libraries to be incorporated into the build
that are not managed by this make system.</p>

<p>The variables that can be modified are:</p>

<dl>

<dt>CPPFLAGS += &lt;options&gt;</dt>

<dd>
<p>Preprocessor flags common to both C and C++ compiles. The most
common and useful of these are extra include paths for libraries
not managed by this make system and therefore not in the LIBRARIES
list.</p>
</dd>

<dt>CFLAGS   += &lt;options&gt;</dt>

<dd>
<p>This sets extra options for the gcc compiler when compiling C code
(.c files) only. These are typically C language specific options.</p>

<p>e.g. CFLAGS += -O3</p>
</dd>

<dt>CXXFLAGS += &lt;options&gt;</dt>

<dd>
<p>This sets extra options for the gcc compiler when compiling C++ code
(.cpp files) only. These are typically C++ language specific options.</p>

<p>e.g. CXXFLAGS  += -ftemplate-depth-50</p>
</dd>

<dt>LDFLAGS += &lt;options&gt;</dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets extra flags for the linker. These are placed <i>before</i> the
object files in the link command</p>

<p>e.g. LDFLAGS  += -s</p>
</dd>

<dt>LDLIBS += &lt;objects&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Extra object files or libraries to be incorporated into the link which are not managed by this
make system. These are placed <i>after</i> the object files in the link command.</p>

<p>The LDLIBS variable can contain names of object files or archive libraries:</p>

<p>e.g. LDLIBS += -lxyz</p>

<p>So in the above case the library being linked against is libxyz.a.</p>

<p>This option is also used to create a dependency on shared libraries (.dll on Windows or .so on
Unixes):</p>

<p>e.g. LDLIBS += -lxyz</p>

<p>So in the above case the library being linked against is either xyz.dll on Windows or libxyz.so
on Unix.</p>

<p>You may need to use the uppercase -L to specify a search path for these libraries:</p>

<p>e.g. LDLIBS += -L../xyz -lxyz</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Note the use of '+=' not ':='. You are adding extra options to the existing
options created by the make system.</p>

<p>There are also some variables that can be used to switch on or off
certain options. These take the values "on" or "off":</p>

<dl>

<dt>RELEASE=on | RELEASE=off (default)</dt>
<dd><p>When switched on, builds a release version of the
application. This has no debugging information and compiler
optimisation is turned up to generate a small, fast program. When
switched off, this builds a debug version, with full debugger
information for use with gdb, and with compiler optimisations
disabled. Note: this is usually swiched on from the command line,
rather than from the Makefile: see <a href="#variants">Building Variants</a>.</p></dd>

<dt>GPROF=on | GPROF=off (default)</dt>
<dd><p>When switched on, builds a profiling version of the application
for use with the gprof profiler. When switched off, this builds a
normal version. Note: this is usually swiched on from the command
line, rather than from the Makefile:
see <a href="#variants">Building Variants</a>.</p></dd>

<dt>UNICODE=on | UNICODE=off (default)</dt>
<dd><p>When switched on, enables Unicode character support. In fact,
this just enables compiler directives -DUNICODE and -D_UNICODE, so
it is up to the programmer to ensure that these are tied to
Unicode support. Most libraries follow this convention.</p></dd>

<dt>STATIC=on | STATIC=off (default)</dt>
<dd><p>When switched on, causes the compiler to link, where possible,
with static C and C++ libraries to minimise dependencies on shared
libraries. This removes a dependency on the C++ STL shared library and
may remove other dependencies too, depending on the
application. You still need to check for any remaining
unresolvable shared library dependencies. If switched off, the
build will use shared libraries where possible to minimise that
application size.</p></dd>

<dt>VERBOSE=on | VERBOSE=off (default)</dt>
<dd><p>When switched off, gives a brief one-line summary of each
build command, unless there are errors in which case a standard error
report is given. When switched on, the build commands are
switched into verbose mode to give more diagnostics.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="targets">Make Targets</h2>

<p>There are several targets that can be used with make. The idea is that
you run make from the command line with a target like this:</p>

<pre class="script">
$ make &lt;target&gt;
</pre>

<p>The target is optional; if missing then the default target is
used.</p>

<p>The targets currently supported by the Makefiles project are:</p>

<dl>

<dt>all (default)</dt>
<dd><p>Equivalent to target 'build', but there are circumstances where
you can change the set of targets mapped onto the 'all' target.</p></dd>

<dt>build</dt>
<dd><p>Compile all source files and link the image if there is one
(i.e. if the IMAGE variable is set) or the shared library if there
is one (i.e. SHARED is set).</p></dd>

<dt>run</dt>
<dd><p>Run the program if there is one (i.e. if the IMAGE variable is
set). Will run the build target first.</p></dd>

<dt>tidy</dt>
<dd><p>Delete intermediate files created during the compile.</p></dd>

<dt>clean</dt>
<dd><p>Delete all files created during the compile, including
temporary files, libraries and the program if there is one.</p>
<p>This is useful if you have made changes to the compile options and need to start from clean.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Targets can be combined on the command line. For example, to build
and run a project:</p>

<pre class="script">
$ make build run
</pre>

<p>Or even, to delete all generated files, build from stratch and then run:</p>

<pre class="script">
$ make clean build run
</pre>

<h2 id="name">Project Name</h2>

<p>The name of the project is either the name of the directory, unless
the directory is called "source" in which case the directory above
that is used. The makefile uses the name of project to generate the
library name.</p>

<p>For example, here is the directory structure of the STLplus project:</p>

<ul>
<li class="folder">stlplus
<ul>
<li class="folder">source
<ul>
<li class="file"><b>Makefile</b></li>
<li class="file">stlplus.hpp</li>
<li class="file">cli_parser.cpp</li>
<li class="file">...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">messages</li>
<li class="folder">docs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example above, for the Makefile shown in bold, the project name is "stlplus". This is because the
directory containing the Makefile is called "source" and so the directory above
that is used. This directory is called "stlplus".</p>

<p>A simpler directory structure could have been used:</p>

<ul>
<li class="folder">stlplus
<ul>
<li class="file"><b>Makefile</b></li>
<li class="file">stlplus.hpp</li>
<li class="file">cli_parser.cpp</li>
<li class="file">...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the project name is still "stlplus". This is because the
directory containing the source is called "stlplus" and so this is used as
the project name.</p>

<p>Project names must be unique within a particular application's development.
For example, you might be working on an application which is split into
several projects for coding purposes. Each project that makes up the
application must have a different project name.</p>

<p>Within a project, all the source code - that is, all headers (.h or .hpp) and
implementation files (.c or .cpp) - must be in one directory. The Makefile
should be in this same directory. A multiple-directory structure should be
built as multiple projects, one per directory.</p>

<h2 id="files">Source Files</h2>

<p>The universal makefile uses file extensions to determine the type of
compilation to use:</p>

<dl>
<dt>.c</dt><dd>C source</dd>
<dt>.cpp</dt><dd>C++ source</dd>
<dt>.rc</dt><dd>resource definitions (Windows only)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Any file with these extensions in the project directory will be compiled using
the appropriate compiler for its type.</p>

<p>So, if you use .c extensions for C++ files you will have problems. I believe
it is good practice to be clear whether a file is C or C++ and so this is a
feature, not a bug.</p>

<p>I also recommend:</p>

<dl>
<dt>.h</dt><dd>a C header</dd>
<dt>.hpp</dt><dd>a C++ header</dd>
<dt>.tpp</dt><dd>a C++ template implementation</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="subdir">Working Directory</h2>

<p>When you compile files with the universal makefile, it stores all compiled
object code in a subdirectory of the source directory. You can clean up by
simply deleting this working directory.</p>

<p>The name of the working directory is derived from the operating system and CPU
type of the computer you are working on. The universal makefile contains a set
of rules for working out this name.</p>

<p>The reason for doing this is that some people work on the same
source code with different compilers and possibly even with disks that
are accessed over a network from one of a number of different
computers. The makefile system keeps the compilations for different
platforms separate. This means that you can, for example, compile your
code on one platform, then compile again for another platform. The
makefile system keeps the working directories separate.</p>

<p>The directory name is in three parts. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
GNULINUX-alpha-debug
</blockquote>

<p>The first part of the name is the generic operating system name - in this case Gnu/Linux. The
operating system is put in uppercase to emphasise that the compiler macro GNULINUX will be defined as a
compiler directive (in this case -DGNULINUX) and can be used in the source code in "#ifdef GNULINUX"
preprocessor directives.</p>

<p>The second part of the name is the CPU type - in this case "alpha" which is the DEC Alpha 64-bit
CPU.</p>

<p>The third part of the name is the build variant - in this case "debug". This
means that this is a debug build of the software - see the next section for
more details of build variants and how to create them.</p>

<h2 id="variants">Building Variants</h2>

<p>The make system can build different variants of a project depending on the
argument following make.</p>

<dl>

<dt>make</dt>
<dd>build a debug version (debug code, no optimisations)</dd>

<dt>make RELEASE=on</dt>
<dd>build a release version (no debug code, highly optimised)</dd>

<dt>make GPROF=on</dt>
<dd>build a profiling version (same parameters as the release version)</dd>

</dl>

<p>Note that these variants are created by specifying values for variables used
to control the build type. See the definitions above for the variables RELEASE,
GPROF, UNICODE, STATIC and VERBOSE. In fact any variable controlling a build can
be set either in a Makefile, meaning always use the same value, or from the
command line, in which case it is a one-off build with that option.</p>

<p>The idea is that you develop using the debug version. This has all symbolic
information required to run a debugger such as Gnu's "gdb" as well as all
macros controlled by the NDEBUG preprocessor directive. The NDEBUG directive
is the ANSI C standard method for including/excluding debugging code in your
source - it is used by the C macro assert(expr) and also the extended
debugging macros provided by the STLplus library header debug.hpp.</p>

<p>You can at any time build a profiling variant for use with Gnu's "gprof". This
allows you to identify any performance problems and optimise code selectively
based on performance profiles. Typically 95% or more of a program is NOT
performance critical, so optimising everything is a huge waste of effort.
Profiling allows you to focus on the 5% of the program that can actually
benefit from optimisation.</p>

<p>Note that the profiling version is built with the same optimisation level as
the release version to give an accurate feel for how the release version will
perform.</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied that your program is entirely bug-free (okay, only
joking) and blindingly fast (yeah, okay, joking again) you can then build a
release variant for shipping to the customer. This will not only run about four
times faster than the debug variant but will be much smaller too. It is also more
difficult to reverse engineer because it doesn't contain any debugging
information.</p>

<h2 id="subdirectories">Subdirectories</h2>

<p>There is a separate set of make rules for handling subdirectory structures.
For example, to make a project with two subprojects, you might have the
following structure:</p>

<ul>
<li class="folder">makefiles
<ul>
<li class="file">gcc.mak</li>
<li class="file">subdirectories.mak</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">project
<ul>
<li class="file"><b>Makefile</b></li>
<li class="folder">subsystem1
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile</li>
<li class="file">xyz123.cpp</li>
<li class="file">efg789.cpp</li>
<li class="file">...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">subsystem2
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile</li>
<li class="file">fgh546.cpp</li>
<li class="file">kld495.cpp</li>
<li class="file">...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I want to write the Makefile (highlighted in bold above) for the top-level "project"
directory that builds the main project by building the two subprojects.</p>

<p>Create a project/Makefile containing one line:</p>

<pre class="script">
include ../makefiles/subdirectories.mak
</pre>

<p>This rule searches for the set of subdirectories that themselves contain a
Makefile and makes them.</p>

<h2 id="wx">Using wxWidgets</h2>

<p>There is an additional universal makefile for use when building
<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> programs. This makefile should be included after the
gcc.mak file.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     := demo
LIBRARIES := ../stlplus3
include ../makefiles/gcc.mak
include ../makefiles/wx.mak
</pre>

<p>The wx.mak file adds extra compiler and linker options for wxWidgets. It uses
the wx-config script provided with wxWidgets to adapt to your installation -
in other words, you need to have run "configure", "make" and "make install" when you built wxWidgets
so that the wx-config program is on the path.</p>

<h3>Shared Library dependencies</h3>

<p>The default is to build a wxWidgets application using shared
libraries for the wxWidgets libraries. This is consistent with the
default configuration of wxWidgets. However, you can build the
application without any wxWidgets shared library dependencies
- as a static build - by specifying the WXSTATIC option in the
Makefile:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     := demo
LIBRARIES := ../stlplus3
WXSTATIC  := on
include ../makefiles/gcc.mak
include ../makefiles/wx.mak
</pre>

<p>For this to build correctly, you must have a non-shared version of
wxWidgets installed, which is done by building wxWidgets with the
"--disable-shared" option for the configure script.</p>

<p>Note: this is different from the STATIC option - which controls
whether the application depends on the C++ shared libraries. The
WXSTATIC option controls whether the application depends on the
wxWidgets shared libraries.</p>

<h3>Selecting a wxWidgets version</h3>

<p>It is possible to have several different versions of wxWidgets installed at
the same time and to select which one to use at build time. This selection is
supported via the WXVERSION option in the Makefile:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     := demo
LIBRARIES := ../stlplus3
WXSTATIC  := on
WXVERSION := 3.0
include ../makefiles/gcc.mak
include ../makefiles/wx.mak
</pre>

<p>This will select version 3.0 of wxWidgets and build the application with it.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Here's a typical Makefile for building a static object library:</p>

<pre class="script">
LIBRARIES := ../stlplus3/portability
include ../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>Here's a typical Makefile for building an executable image:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     := ../bin/ccolour
LIBRARIES := ../stlplus3/portability
include ../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>To show the whole picture, here's a multi-library project for the "ccolour"
program with the directory structure and makefiles used to build it. The
ccolour project uses the stlplus3 project. To build the whole project, all you
have to do is to go into the source directory of the ccolour directory and run
make:</p>

<ul>
<li class="folder">development
<ul>
<li class="folder">bin
<ul>
<li class="file">ccolour.exe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">makefiles
<ul>
<li class="file">gcc.mak</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">stlplus3
<ul>
<li class="folder">portability
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile:
<pre>include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak</pre>
</li>
<li class="file">file_system.hpp</li>
<li class="file">file_system.cpp</li>
<li class="file">...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">containers
<ul>
<li class="file">...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">ccolour
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile:
<pre>IMAGE     := ../bin/ccolour<br/>LIBRARIES := ../stlplus3/portability<br/>include ../makefiles/gcc.mak</pre>
</li>
<li class="file">ccolour.cpp</li>
<li class="file">...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
